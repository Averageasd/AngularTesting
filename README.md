# AngularTestSample
Project to learn unit testing in angular

## About
I learnt how to use TestBed to resolve dependencies and different ways of mocking injected services. I also learnt how to use nativeElement
and debugElement to have access to UI elements in angular and simulate UI interactions.

## Technologies
Angular, Jasmine, TestBed.

## Note:
This project purpose is just to demonstrate how testing is done in Angular. The UI is very plain and simple.
